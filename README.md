## About

The challenge faced by generating multi-agent simulations is determining the order in which the agents speak.
To address this challenge, this application uses a "director" agent to decide the order in which the agents speak.
You can find an example of how to implement this in the [LangChain docs](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/agent_simulations/multiagent_authoritarian.html).
